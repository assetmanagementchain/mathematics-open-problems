Proof of Eventual Monotonicity of p_k (n)
We prove that for each fixed integer k≥2, the restricted partition functio

is strictly increasing for all sufficiently large n.

1. Generating Function
The generating function for p_k (n) is

Define

Then

2. Coefficient Asymptotics
Since F_k (x)is a rational function with poles only at roots of unity, and the dominant pole is at x=1, expanding around x=1gives the standard polynomial-type asymptotic

where

This follows from standard transfer theorems in analytic combinatorics applied to pole of order k.
Thus,

3. Strict Positivity of the Leading Term
Compute the polynomial difference:

Thus,
<img width="1357" height="124" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a6ec2c8-58c6-4d83-8bc3-7e7d8e9bb7dc" />
Since

the dominant term is strictly positive.
Therefore,

for all sufficiently large n.

4. Conclusion
For every fixed integer k≥2, the restricted partition function p_k (n)is eventually strictly increasing.
Thus the conjecture is proved.
    Monotonicity holds for all sufficiently large n.
