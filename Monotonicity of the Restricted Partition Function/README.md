# H1-A2: Monotonicity of the Restricted Partition Function

We prove that the restricted partition function p_k(n), 
which counts partitions of n with maximum part ≤ k,
is monotone increasing in n.

That is:
p_k(n+1) ≥ p_k(n) for all n ≥ 0.

A simple injective argument gives a complete proof.
Verification code is included in /src.
