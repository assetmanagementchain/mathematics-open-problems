# Erdős Problem #1 – Structural Proof Framework
Author: Xu Xin (2025)

This repository contains my structural proof approach for the classical Erdős Problem #1:
https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/1

⚠️ This project does *not* claim a complete solution.

What it provides is a *full architectural framework* for a proof, including:

- a finite reduction (N ≤ 184),
- a local additive-structure lemma (Freiman-type),
- an energy → Fourier spectrum constraint,
- classification of candidate configurations,
- and a finite-check mechanism.

These elements together significantly restrict possible counterexamples  
and reduce the original infinite problem into a small, explicit, analyzable family.

The framework is original work by **Xu Robert (2025)**.  
Any usage of these ideas or operators must credit this repository.
