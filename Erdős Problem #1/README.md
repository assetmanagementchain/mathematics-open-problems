# Erdős Problem #1 – Structural Proof Framework  
Author: **Xu Xin (2025)**  

This repository contains my **structural proof approach** for the classical Erdős Problem #1:  
https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/1  

⚠️ **This project does *not* claim a complete solution.**  

Instead, it presents a **full architectural framework** including:

- a *finite reduction* (showing any counterexample must satisfy \( N \le 184 \))
- a *local additive-structure lemma* (Freiman-type)
- an *energy → Fourier spectrum constraint*
- a *classification of candidate configurations*
- a *finite-check mechanism*

These components significantly restrict possible counterexamples and  
convert the infinite problem into a **small explicit family** analyzable by computation.

All structural methods, operators, and reductions are **original work by Xu Robert (2025)**.  
Any use of these ideas must credit this repository.
