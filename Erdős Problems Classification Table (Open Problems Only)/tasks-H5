# Erdős Problems — H5 (Open, Governance-Level Problems)

> This page lists **H5 Erdős problems**:
>
> Problems whose difficulty does **not** lie in proving a single statement,
> but in **governing a family of evolving rules or structures**.
>
> These problems do not admit a stable terminal theorem without
> first introducing:
> - rule versioning
> - family classification
> - structural governance principles
>
> They are **not standard “solve-or-not” problems**.

## A. Covering Systems (Canonical H5)

Covering systems are the **clearest H5 class** in the Erdős corpus.

Key characteristics:
- Rule space evolves with new constraints
- Counterexamples reshape admissible families
- No single invariant defines a terminal solution

## B. Axiom-Dependent Set-Theoretic Ramsey (H4/H5 Boundary)

These problems exhibit **governance tendencies**:
their truth values or optimal formulations depend on
set-theoretic assumptions.

They are not fully H5 yet, but **cannot be treated as pure H4**.

### Boundary Problems

- [#591](https://www.erdosproblems.com/591)  
  *Set theory, Ramsey theory*

- [#592](https://www.erdosproblems.com/592)  
  *Set theory, Ramsey theory*

- [#598](https://www.erdosproblems.com/598)  
  *Set theory, Ramsey theory*

- [#623](https://www.erdosproblems.com/623)  
  *Set theory*

> Recommended label: **H4/H5 boundary (axiom-dependent)**

## Notes

- These problems **should not be merged into H4**:
  H4 problems lack a solution *due to missing mathematics*,
  while H5 problems lack a solution *due to unstable rule definitions*.
- Erdős Problems contain **no genuine H6+ cases**:
  all problems remain object-level mathematical questions.
- Covering systems form the **only fully realized H5 class** in the corpus.

---

## Summary

- **H5 problems are rare but structurally distinct**
- Correct handling requires:
  - rule governance
  - family classification
  - explicit non-terminal framing
- Attempting classical proofs on H5 problems
  leads to repeated structural dead-ends
