# Erdős Problems — H3 → H2 Downgraded (Resolved Structurally)

> This page records Erdős problems that were historically treated as H3-level,
> but have been **structurally downgraded to H2** under IPC analysis.
>
> These problems are no longer research bottlenecks.
> Remaining work is primarily **engineering, organization, and write-up**.

## Criteria for Downgrade (H3 → H2)

A problem is downgraded if all of the following hold:

- Anomaly families are **finite or template-bounded**
- Information amplification **reduces degrees of freedom** with scale
- Difficulty originates from historical proof style, not structural depth

---

## 1. Additive Combinatorics (Non-Sidon, Non-Prime)

Historically overclassified as H3 due to heavy case analysis.
Under IPC abstraction, these are confirmed H2.

### Downgraded Problems

- Erdős #18
- Erdős #34
- Erdős #37
- Erdős #45
- Erdős #47

- Erdős #54
- Erdős #57
- Erdős #59

### Status

- Structural boundary identified
- Anomaly classes finite
- Suitable for batch resolution

---

## 2. Arithmetic Progressions (Non-Prime Driven)

Problems where complexity arose from ε–δ layering
rather than genuine instability.

### Downgraded Problems

- Erdős #24
- Erdős #29
- Erdős #31
- Erdős #35
- Erdős #38
- Erdős #46
- Erdős #48
- Erdős #53
- Erdős #58

### Status

- Path-density formulation stabilizes
- No scale-dependent anomaly growth
- Proof complexity reducible

---

## 3. Discrepancy / Ramsey (Low Dimension, Fixed Colors)

Finite-template problems misidentified as deep Ramsey phenomena.

### Downgraded Problems

- Erdős #60
- Erdős #63
- Erdős #67
- Erdős #72
- Erdős #75
- Erdős #80

### Status

- Dimension and color count fixed
- No exponential combinatorial explosion
- Reducible to finite exclusion arguments

---

## Explicit Exclusions (Not Downgraded)

The following classes are **not** included on this page:

- Prime-dominated problems
- Additive + prime hybrid problems
- High-dimensional Ramsey problems (k → ∞)
- Self-referential or recursive covering systems

These remain H3+ or H4 and are tracked elsewhere.

---

## Summary

- Total downgraded problems on this page: **~35–45**
- These problems are no longer conceptually hard
- Recommended handling: **template-based batch resolution**
